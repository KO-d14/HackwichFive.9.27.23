//------------------ Hackwich #5 Part 1: Working W/ Arrays --------------------
    // Has parts 1-7 & Problem Set for Tab 2
// PART 1: Create a New Xcode Project (2 points):

// PART 2: Remove VC and Add a Tab Bar Controller (2 points)
// NOTE: CREATED NAV BAR CONTROLLER EVEN THO INSTRUCTION DOESN'T SAY

// (PART 3 WRITTEN SOMEWHERE BELOW)

// PART 4: Set Top Label‚Äôs Text (2 points)
    /*1. Set the topLabel‚Äôs text to: ‚ÄúMy Favorite Foods:‚Äù (in code) and have the text display in the label when the app first opens. Please note this is the top label on your VC.*/

// PART 5: Declare and Assign two variables (2 points)
//1. Declare a variable of type Integer and name it ‚ÄúcurrentIndex‚Äù and assign it to the  integer, 0.
 var currentIndex = 0
//2. Declare an array variable and name it, ‚ÄúfavoriteFoodsArray‚Äù and assign it to 5 items of type String that are the names of your favorite foods.
var favoriteFoodsArray = ["Ice Cream", "Dim Sum", "Bread", "Sushi", "Soup/Stew-Related"]

// PART 7: Set an image for the Tab Bar Item and Change the attributes for the button (2 points)
    /*
     1.Set an image for the Tab Bar Item.
     2.Change attributes for the button (if you haven ªt yet)
     3. Change the text for the button to ‚ÄúSee My Fave Foods‚Äù
     4. Run the simulator. Please feel free to review my simulator recording. Also, what happens if you press the button more than once? Notice that if you press the button again, it doesn‚Äôt iterate through the array. What code do we need to add to our IBAction that will enable the button to iterate through the array upon a button press? We will work on this part in Week 7.

// Part 1: Set up a if/else statement to iterate through each item in array upon button press (10 points)

                #2. (written in above designated line of code)

- When you write (buttonLabel!).isEnabled, you're telling the computer, "I'm sure that buttonLabel has a value, so let me access its isEnabled property."
- a good metaphor to understand: So, using (buttonLabel!).isEnabled is a bit like saying, "I'm absolutely sure there's a cookie in the jar, so I'll just reach in without checking. But if the jar is empty, I'll accidentally break it."
